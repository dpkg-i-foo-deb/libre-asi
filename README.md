# This project has been archived

A new implementation will be developed aiming for a more stable design as well as making sure most parts of the architecture are testable and modular

# Context
The addiction severity index. Created by Thomas McLellan, Ph. D. and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980. It is an instrument used to realise a multidimensional analysis of a patient, this is done through a semi structured interview where multiple areas are evaluated. It is a very useful tool when it comes to addiction treatment planification

# Is it useful?
Multiple researchers have proven the addiction severity index is both effective on its results and its usefulness on scientific research as well as treatment follow-up. There is a full investigation where I collected this data (Sadly, in Spanish)

# The goal
The goal is to create a software tool that assists the interview and filling out the addiction severity index form. There are multiple ways to improve the process. For example, providing examples and help for each question, multiple versions and languages, teamwork, data persistence, automatic results, etc.

# Being Realistic
This project is big and ambitious. At the moment, the scale is limited to a basic prototype to demonstrate what a final product would look like and how it could be useful for the interview process

# Prior Analysis
In an attempt to create a better software product, there was a prior analysis of the processes that involved the addiction severity index form. It will most likely contain errors but it helped me to create a better idea of what Iâ€™m dealing with (In Spanish, sadly)

# Diagrams
Some diagrams were created in order to understand the form and its structure, they should be available in the "modelling" directory

# Architecture
There was an attempt to model the architecture I planned for this prototype
